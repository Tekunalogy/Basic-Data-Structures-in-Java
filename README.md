# Basic-Data-Structures-in-Java
UCSD CSE 12 - Spring 2020

Each assignment is complete. However, most of these assignments do not take care of some edge cases which resulted in a lower score.
All of this code is 100% 'handmade', but many algorithms used in each assignment are well known algorithms that were obviously not discovered
or invented by me.

Scores for each assignment (PA#):

1. 100%
2. 100%
3. 91%
4. 97.5%
5. 93.5%
6. 95%
7. 82%
8. 104% (completed extra credit, but also failed some edge cases)
9. 95%
